📚 Simple E-Library (HTML Only)

This project is a basic e-library website layout built using only HTML.
It is a practice project to understand how to structure a library-style website without using CSS, JavaScript, or databases.

Users can:

View a simple list of available books.

See book details like title, author, and category.

Use links/buttons to simulate actions like “Read More” or “Download” (links are placeholders since this is HTML-only).


The goal of this project is to practice HTML tables, links, and content organization in a human-friendly way, showing how an online library might look at its simplest level.
